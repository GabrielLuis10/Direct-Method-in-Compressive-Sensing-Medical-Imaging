# Direct Method in Compressive Sensing Medical Imaging

This repository contains supplementary material to my master's research in the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering at the University of Bras√≠lia (PPGEE/UnB). Here is the raw data regarding the numerical experiments discussed in the thesis. Broadly speaking, these experiments aim to evaluate the use of direct methods in a new Compressive Sensing-based algorithm for medical image reconstruction.

I will update this description with the link to the thesis as soon as possible. Part of the development has been published in the proceedings of a conference (ICBBS 2021) and is available at [doi.org/10.1145/3498731.3498733](doi.org/10.1145/3498731.3498733)
